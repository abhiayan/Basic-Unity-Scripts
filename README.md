##Shoot The Hoop
This project contains all neccesary files and assets neccesary for running the game Shoot The Hoop. It is a game which I build as part of a computer programming and game development course which I did on Udemy.
Some basic Unity functionalities which I made as a beginner level Unity C# programmer. Feel free to improve and use.
